Combine annotation and differential expression file and write common gene names
along with description and p-value in a tab-separated file

# Step by step procedures:
    Step-1: read annotation file
            i) read columns 4 and 5. column 4: gene name; column 5: description
            ii) store data into dict. {key:gene name and value: description}
    Step-2: read  differential expression data file
            i) read columns 1 and 5. column 4: gene name; column 5: p-value
            ii) store data into dict. {key:gene name and value: p-value}
    Step-3: write output to a file
            i) find out common genes in two dicts
            ii) write gene name, description and p-value in a tab-separated file
